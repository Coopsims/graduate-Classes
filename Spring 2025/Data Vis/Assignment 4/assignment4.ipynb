    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadrant plot provides a clear visualization of player performance across both offensive and defensive dimensions. Players are categorized into four groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Elite Two-Way Players** (top-right quadrant): These players excel in both offensive and defensive aspects of the game.\n",
    "2. **Offensive Specialists** (bottom-right quadrant): These players are strong offensively but below average defensively.\n",
    "3. **Defensive Specialists** (top-left quadrant): These players are strong defensively but below average offensively.\n",
    "4. **Below Average** (bottom-left quadrant): These players are below average in both offensive and defensive metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The color gradient based on minutes played adds another dimension to the analysis, showing which players receive more playing time. Generally, players who excel in both dimensions (top-right quadrant) tend to receive more minutes, as indicated by the darker colors in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization allows coaches, analysts, and fans to quickly identify player strengths and weaknesses, and can be useful for team building, matchup analysis, and player development planning."
